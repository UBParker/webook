## üåü Features
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Understand user queries such as "Find me a flight to Paris on December 15th."
- **Flight Search Integration:** Connect with popular flight search APIs like Amadeus, Skyscanner, and Kiwi.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Offer flight options tailored to user preferences (e.g., price, duration, layovers).
- **Secure Booking Workflow:** Finalize bookings directly through airline or travel service APIs.
- **Expandable Architecture:** Future support for adjacent services like hotel reservations and car rentals.
